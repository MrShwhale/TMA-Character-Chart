# Graphs.json
This section has a little bit of info about the formatting behind graphs.json

## General
graphs.json is an array of episodes.
Each of these epidsodes has certain groups and characters.
Each episode represents what an astute viewer would know at that point, not necesarily what the current state of things is.
Each episode is based on the information available by the end of the episode.

# Reminders
Potentially DON'T connect Hezekiah Wakely and Karolina GÃ³rka

Add Officer Altman in 5, and perhaps pick an Altman to connect him to?

Perhaps change how the NotThem is connected (current: Is connection to each alias, each alias kills the replaced).

Gerard Keay's assult of Lightner might have been mentioned earlier than episode 80.

Add Diego Molina to episode 12.

Make sure Oliver is actually named in 32, otherwise rename to vague man.

Consider adding "Henry" to episode 50.

Consider adding a group for Breekon+Hope since nothing is ever connected to just one

Consider naming Mary's mother Mary in 62, for lore reasons

Eye alignment can be made before episode 93 when Elias admits to murder

Add Ellis connection to the Vast when Gertrude is revealed to have stopped the ritual

Change a bunch of The Stranger's aligned to avatars

Double check all alignments

Consider if you want feeling to be an actual part of the chart

Update Jon's summary earlier

Update a bunch of emotion stuff on ep 117 and before (jon-melanie)

Update the summaries of a bunch of characters (or don't)

Add Daisy Hunt at some point

Maybe add George Gilbert Scott as connected to one of the powers

Wikilinks need to be checked

Mary Keay's family is a mess

Figure out better stuff for 160?

All relations might need to change for 161, like making everyone unknown

Add a "technically not dead" status for those times where it is useful (Buried, coma, etc.)

Notify that people just chilling in hellscapes will not be recorded

Change Basira/Daisy relationship to friends

Relationship changes in 180?

Add group "people Jon evaporated"

Maybe add Elias inspector when he is arrested

Add Celia connection to Martin back in the day?

Consider special type for Magnus as the Pupil
