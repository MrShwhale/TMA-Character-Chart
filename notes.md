# Graphs.json
This section has a little bit of info about the formatting behind graphs.json

## General
graphs.json is an array of episodes.
Each of these epidsodes has certain groups and characters.

# Reminders
Connect Nicole Baxter with Julia and Trevor on episode 107 (or add the ability to combine people and put the 2 mysterious people into episode 30-whatever)

Connect Oliver Banks with Jennifer Ling after Oliver's statement (121) (or add the ability to combine people and put the odd man into episode 42)

Connect King to Ivy Medows director (through father) on episode 106

Mark the hospitaller as being of the Magnus Institute/Eye in episode 191

Perhaps connect people through shared artifacts (Calliope, Web table)

Consider people like Christopher Meyer, who is connected to the old Institute but not part of it.

Potentially connect Hezekiah Wakely (152) and Karolina GÃ³rka (71)

Add Officer Altman in 5, and perhaps pick an Altman to connect him to?

Perhaps change how the NotThem is connected (current: Is connection to each alias, each alias kills the replaced).

Gerard Keay's assult of Lightner might have been mentioned earlier than episode 80.

Add Diego Molina to episode 12.

Make sure Oliver is actually named in 32, otherwise rename to vague man.

Consider adding "Henry" to episode 50.

Consider adding a group for Breekon+Hope since nothing is ever connected to just one

Consider naming Mary's mother Mary in 62, for lore reasons

Eye alignment can be made before episode 93 when Elias admits to murder

Add Ellis connection to the Vast when Gertrude is revealed to have stopped the ritual

Add all connections to The Buried in ep 99

Add all connections to The Spiral in ep 101

Add all connectons to The Corruption in ep 102
